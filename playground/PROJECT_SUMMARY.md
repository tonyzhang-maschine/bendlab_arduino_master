- **GUI Framework:** PyQtGraph-based interface with controls

### Features Implemented
- ✅ Real-time statistics panel (max, mean per region)
- ✅ Start/Stop controls
- ✅ Connection status indicator
- ✅ Log panel with timestamps
- ✅ FPS counter and frame tracking
- ✅ Hand outline visualization
- ✅ 136 sensor dot positions

### Documentation (✅ Complete)

- Documentation index (DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md)
- Architecture details (realtime_vis_plan.md)
- Legacy code archived and documented

## 🔴 **Known Issues**

### Issue #1: Visualization Colors Not Updating (CRITICAL)
**Impact:** Main feature non-functional  
**Symptom:** All sensor dots remain black despite active data  
**Evidence:** Statistics show values (max=3-6) but colors don't update  
**Next Step:** Debug `hand_visualizer.py` color update logic

### Issue #2: Sensor Mapping Cross-talk (MINOR)
**Impact:** Reduced accuracy  
**Symptom:** Adjacent fingers may trigger each other  
**Evidence:** Pressing index finger sometimes shows thumb values  
**Next Step:** Finger isolation testing to verify mapping

### Issue #3: GUI Freezing (INTERMITTENT)
**Impact:** User experience  
**Symptom:** Occasional freezing/flickering  
**Hypothesis:** Related to data saving or queue overflow  
**Next Step:** Performance profiling

---

## 📈 **Performance Metrics**

### Achieved
- **Capture Rate:** ~76 Hz (below 200 Hz target, but stable)
- **Display Rate:** 11.7 FPS (acceptable, near 15 Hz target)
- **Latency:** <100ms (good for real-time)
- **Statistics:** Real-time updates working correctly

### Areas for Improvement
- Increase capture rate (investigate parser overhead)
- Optimize visualization updates
- Reduce GUI thread blocking

## 🎓 **Lessons Learned**

### Technical Insights

1. **Sensor Mapping Complexity**
   - Documentation indices ≠ sequential (1-255, not 0-161)
   - Index 238 appears twice (finger + finger back)
   - 136 unique sensors, not 162 as initially thought

2. **PyQtGraph for Real-time**
   - Better than Matplotlib for high-frequency updates
   - ScatterPlotItem efficient for 136 points
   - Need to understand update/refresh mechanisms better

3. **Threading Model**
   - Qt signals/slots essential for thread safety
   - Queue-based buffering prevents blocking
   - Frame dropping acceptable for real-time display

### Development Process

1. **Started with exploration** (capture scripts)
2. **Moved to static analysis** (offline visualization)
3. **Built real-time system** (current MVP)
4. **Documented and organized** (this cleanup)

### What Worked Well
- ✅ Incremental development approach
- ✅ Test-driven debugging (test_compatibility.py)
- ✅ Modular architecture (easy to update components)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

### What Could Be Better
- ⚠️ Should have tested visualization colors earlier
- ⚠️ Sensor mapping needed physical verification sooner
- ⚠️ Performance profiling should be ongoing

## 🔧 **Technical Debt**

### Code Improvements Needed
1. **Visualization Debug** - Fix color update mechanism
2. **Sensor Positions** - Refine XY coordinates for realistic layout
3. **Error Handling** - Add more robust exception handling
4. **Performance** - Profile and optimize bottlenecks
5. **Data Export** - Add recording functionality

### Documentation Maintenance
- ✅ STATUS.md updated
- ✅ Known issues documented
- ✅ Architecture explained
- ⏳ Need user manual for end-users
